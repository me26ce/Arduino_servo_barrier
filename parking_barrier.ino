- Button debouncing  
- Smooth servo motion  
- Adjustable timer and servo speed  
- LED indicators

## 🚀 How It Works

1. The ultrasonic sensor continuously measures distance.  
2. If a vehicle/object is detected within a defined threshold, the barrier opens.  
3. The push button can also open the barrier manually.  
4. Barrier stays open for a configurable duration.  
5. Servo slowly closes the barrier.  
6. New triggers reset the timer.
